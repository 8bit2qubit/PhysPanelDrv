A minimalist and lightweight Windows kernel driver designed to **override the physical display panel dimensions** reported to the operating system. This allows simulating different screen sizes (e.g., a handheld device) to influence UI behavior in certain applications and system components, such as the Windows Shell or DirectX games.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Please Read Before Proceeding

This is a **kernel-mode driver** that interacts with undocumented Windows internals. By using this software, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

*   **System Instability** ‚Äì Kernel-mode code runs with the highest privilege. Any bugs or incompatibilities can cause system instability, crashes (Blue Screen of Death - BSOD), data corruption, or require a complete OS reinstallation.
*   **Use Entirely at Your Own Risk** ‚Äì You are solely responsible for any consequences. The developer provides no warranty, support, or liability for any damages whatsoever.
*   **Security Implications** ‚Äì Installing this driver requires disabling security features like Secure Boot and enabling Test Signing Mode, which can lower your system's security posture.
*   **Undocumented APIs** ‚Äì This driver relies on internal Windows functions (`ZwUpdateWnfStateData`) that are not officially supported and may change or be removed in any Windows update, causing the driver to fail or crash the system.
*   **Backup Is Essential** ‚Äì Always create a full system backup and a System Restore Point before installing any kernel-mode driver.

**If you are not comfortable with these risks, do not use this software.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

*   **Operating System**: Windows 11 Build 26100 / 26200 / 26220 (x64)
*   **Permissions**: Administrator privileges are required for installation and removal.
*   **System State**: **Secure Boot** must be **disabled** and **Test Signing Mode** must be **enabled**.
*   **Required Tools**: The installation and removal process relies on `devcon.exe`, which is part of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

## üíª Technical Details

*   **Language**: C
*   **Toolchain**: Windows Driver Kit (WDK)
*   **Core API**: The driver utilizes the undocumented kernel API `ZwUpdateWnfStateData` to publish a new value for a well-known Windows Notification Facility (WNF) state.
*   **WNF State Name**: `WNF_DX_INTERNAL_PANEL_DIMENSIONS`. This state is used internally by DirectX and other components to determine the physical size of the primary display panel.
